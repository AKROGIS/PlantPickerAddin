Carl will maintain the database in MS Access.
when Carl provides an updated database, do the following:
1) open the DB in MS Access
2) run the queries in code.sql to create the picklist tables
3) export the database to Access 2003 format and call it Plants.mdb
4) Run the CreatePlantFGDB.py script.  If it fails:
     a) Check the directory path in the script
	 b) Check for database schema changes that would effect the table to table copies 
	 c) Check that an ArcGIS upgrade has not changed the ground rules
	 d) The script can be recreated from the model in DENA_Plants.tbx
	    check the input parameters in edit mode before running.
5) The FGDB plants.gdb should now be upto date.
6) The layer files have relative paths to plants.gdb
7) Copy the layer files and plants.gdb to C:\Plants (or the 
   directory path in plantRank.cs and PlantSpecies.cs)
8) install the addin
9) The tool is presented as a toolbar with 2 (or more) special picklists
