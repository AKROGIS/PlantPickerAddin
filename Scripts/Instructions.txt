Carl will maintain the database in MS Access.
when Carl provides an updated database, do the following:
1) open the DB in MS Access
2) run the queries in code.sql to create the picklist tables
3) export the database to Access 2003 format and call it 
   C:\Users\resarwas\Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Projects\PlantPickerAddIn\Data\Plants.mdb
4) Run the CreatePlantFGDB.py script.  If it fails:
     a) Check the directory path in the script
	 b) Check for database schema changes that would effect the table to table copies 
	 c) Check that an ArcGIS upgrade has not changed the ground rules
	 d) The script can be recreated from the model in DENA_Plants.tbx
	    check the input parameters in edit mode before running.
5) The FGDB plants.gdb should now be up to date.
6) Delete the plants.mdb
7) The unique values symbology list in Plant Species by State Rank.lyr should be
   update to by using 'Add All Values' to capture any changes to the
   locally accepted name (Taxon_txtLocalAcceptedName). 
8) Copy the layer files and plants.gdb to C:\Plants (or the 
   directory path in SpeciesLayerFactory.cs)
9) install the addin
10) The tool is presented as a toolbar with several special picklists
